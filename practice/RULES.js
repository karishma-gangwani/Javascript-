// 1. special numbers -
// Infinity
// and -infinity

// 2. Newlines (characters that you get when you press enter)
// can be included without escaping only when the string is quoted with baclticks (`)
// When a baclslash \ is found inside a quoted text it indicated that the character after it has a special meaning. This is called escaping the character.
// a quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string but be a part if it.

// 3. Dont need to define a function in ES6. can directly use the name of the function and pass the argument/value in it.
// Also don't need to define key, value pairs for object literals in ES6.

// 4. The elements in an array are stored as the array's properties, using numbers as property names.
// Property names are strings. so if you want to access the property named by the value held in the binding i, you say value[i].
// for example, to access the property named 2 or John we say value[2] or value["John"].

// 5. toUpperCase and toLowerCase. string property.
// properties that contain functions are generally called methods of the value they belong to, as in "toUpperCase is a method of a string"

// 6. Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties.

// 7. instead of if-else use ternary operator

// 8. instead of for loop use foreach or reduce

// 9. instead of keyword function use arrowfunctions to create funcitons but it cannnot use the this keyword so very selective use.
// function expression is the best way to write a function.

// 10. Map -
// use to create a new array and filter is used for filtering through

// 11. to check type of object.
// console.log(typeof 'object/variable')

// 12. think about functions within functions. complexity? you don't want to change the function in multiple places. writing a smarter and more efficient code. think what if?

// 13. for an if statement - console.log should come above the return statement otherwise it will not get printed.

// 14. use the this method. use it to create new properties.
// this refers to the object itself. so this can be used as the object itself to call properties or methods.

// 15. always try to compute the values.

// 17. use .push to add objects at the end of the array and not unshift/shift which does it at the beginning of the array.

// 18. continue and break - keywords

// 19. use Math properties.

// 20. prompt function always returns a string.

// 21. console.table - to display the object table

// 22. Debugging - you can type debugger; in ypur program to open the debugger in the console.
// debugging is used to check the working and errors in your code.
